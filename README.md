## MD-make
---
### Description

I wrote this script to automate the generation of md-files for my OOP-class assignment. I also wrote a very specific find and replace program in c++. I don't think anyone can use this code(the script is too specific) but the whole thing was written well under an hour so things could go south.

### Usage

#### Make:
* Need zsh.
* Compile replacer.
* Add an alias for the binary in zsh called replacer-mine.

#### Use:
>Use md-make -t <template_file> -d <source_directory> -o <output_file> to create assignment files.
